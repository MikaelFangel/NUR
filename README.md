My personal [NUR](https://github.com/nix-community/NUR) repository where I'll host experimental packages, herunder applications not suiteable for Nixpkgs. I'll also host fasttracks of some packages that I find useful and are too impatient to wait for Nixpkgs to upstream.

## Package wishes

If you have a package you wish adopted here or are waiting for please feel free to submit an issue.

## Package removal

I'll remove packages that become part of nixpkgs or are updated to their current version.
